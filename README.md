<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a short introduction on how to use Flutter to easily create and design apps. We focused on the design aspect and the demo in the lib.main.dart file gives a quick overview of the architecture and structure of Flutter.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Getting Started

To install Flutter you can follow the documentation on <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/install"> Install Flutter </a> and/or follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

You need:

<a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/install/manual">Download the SDK file</a> zip folder for Ubuntu and Linux

Alternatively you can also use <a href="https://dartpad.dev/"> DartPad </a> to start learning Dart and Flutter.

### Installation

In your Ubuntu terminal use:

<pre>
sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y curl git unzip xz-utils zip libglu1-mesa
</pre>

Extract the prerequisite Flutter SDK into the folder you downloaded it to.

When the SDK folder is unzipped move the folder into your Ubuntu root folder

In your terminal navigate into the Flutter folder and use the ‘code .’ command to open the Flutter folder in VS Code, which will download the required files.

You will be asked to create a path for your Flutter projects.

Finally use the command ‘flutter doctor’ in your VS Code terminal to review any potential missing packages which are to be installed using ‘sudo apt install package-name’ and then you can check your installed version using ‘flutter - -version’.

Close VS Code as this is not a project but just the necessary files for Flutter to work.

Creating Your Project

Launch Visual Studio Code and open the command palette.

Start typing "flutter new". Select the Flutter: New Project command.

Select Application and then a folder in which to create your project. This could be your home directory, or another specific folder.

In order to specify the target device for your project development, you need to use the device icon in the status bar (at the bottom of the VS Code window) where you will be prompted to select a target device for your development.

To run the project you can run it in Debug mode, which will open a window that has hot reload enabled so that you can code and see live updates as you develop. Debug mode will pause when you encounter an error.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Flutter is a UI toolkit from Google that lets you build mobile, web, and desktop apps from a single codebase. You write your app in Dart, structure your interface using widgets and Flutter renders everything itself instead of relying on the platform’s native UI components. This ensure that the look and behaviour of the app stays consistent across all platforms.

_For a more detailed explanation of Flutter, please refer to the [Documentation](https://flutter.dev/)_

<!-- Reflection -->

## Reflection

We set out to review the Flutter framework, learning some of the language used and to understand the development from Dart. In order to address the main requirements of this project we began constructing a plan using Trello, outlining our communication methods, organising the main goals of our presentation, and underlining how we were to go about research to ensure joint understanding of Flutter.

It may be said that we started with a broad scope, with intentions of understanding Dart as well as the Flutter framework. This was something that we had to roll back a little bit on because of the differences between the JavaScript language that we have been learning and the object oriented development practices of Dart. We also wanted to get a deeper understanding of Flutter from a coding perspective, and whilst we were able to construct a clear Demo model, the decision was made that the demo itself was to focus solely on the ability to manipulate and update the UI with ease to demonstrate the simplicity of the modular design aspects that Flutter was created for.

We also found it difficult to install the Flutter SDK at the start; we found that the documents were not super helpful and so we had to find a way around it.

We worked cohesively as a team and found very little to disagree on. Our communication was fluid and we were able to share tasks without any concerns or issues. We helped each other to understand aspects of our individual research and guided one another on installation issues. All-in-all it was a smooth and slick process and we are comfortable with our final project.

Other than the struggles that we experienced during installation, once we had everything working we found that the Flutter framework was very easy to use for building applications. We both struggle with design and css and so leapt at the chance to learn about this framework in order to improve our app design. We found that the modularity being used in the framework allowed for simple code structures to be constructed for reasonably complex actions, and the clear scaffolding and information provided directly within VS Code whilst coding meant that we were able to find issues or points of concern quickly and efficiently.
